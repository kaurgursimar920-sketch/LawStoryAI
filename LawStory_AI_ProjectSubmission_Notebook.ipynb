    "1) Problem Definition & Objective  \n",
    "a. Selected project track  \n",
    "\n",
    "AI + Automation (LLM + Video Rendering Pipeline)  \n",
    "This project is built under the **AI + Automation** track, combining **LLM-based legal understanding** with an automated **video rendering pipeline**. The goal is to build a system that can take a **court judgment PDF as the only input**, extract the most meaningful legal information, and automatically convert it into a short, structured **multi-scene explainer video**. The entire process is designed to work without manual editing, manual scriptwriting, or manual video creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Clear problem statement  \n",
    "\n",
    "Legal judgments are long, technical, and written in a format that is difficult to consume quickly. Even when someone has access to the judgment PDF, understanding it requires significant time and effort to identify the key parts like **facts, legal issues, arguments from both sides, and the final reasoning of the court**. The problem this project solves is: **how to automatically convert a judgment PDF into an easy-to-consume, structured multi-scene video without manual intervention.** Without this kind of system, users are forced to either spend hours reading, depend on scattered online summaries, or miss the core learning from the judgment entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Real-world relevance and motivation  \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is highly real and urgent because legal awareness and legal education depend on access to understandable information, but judgments are not written for quick comprehension.  \n",
    "- **Law students and common people** struggle to understand judgments quickly because of complex language, length, and legal formatting.  \n",
    "- **Lawyers, educators, and legal creators** need short explainers to teach, spread awareness, and simplify complex case law.  \n",
    "- Existing options usually require manual summarization or manual video editing, which is slow and not scalable.  \n",
    "- This pipeline makes legal content dramatically more accessible by converting it into an explainer format that can be consumed in minutes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project solves a gap that is not addressed effectively by traditional reading, short notes, or generic summaries. It can directly power **LawStory AI** as a product feature where a user uploads a judgment PDF and receives a structured explainer video output automatically."

    "2) Data Understanding & Preparation  \n",
    "a. Dataset source (public / synthetic / collected / API)  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project does not use a fixed “traditional dataset” like CSVs or labeled training data. Instead, it uses **live real-world input** in the form of **judgment PDFs**. The data source includes:  \n",
    "- **Collected / user-provided judgment PDF documents**  \n",
    "- **Extracted text generated from those PDFs** through processing inside the Make.com scenario  \n",
    "\n",
    "So the “data” here is **unstructured legal text extracted from actual court judgments**, making it realistic, variable, and challenging in a way that reflects real product usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Data loading and exploration  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data enters the system through Make.com as:  \n",
    "- A **Webhook input** containing the judgment PDF URL/file  \n",
    "- An **HTTP module** that fetches/downloads the judgment PDF  \n",
    "- A **Custom JS module** that extracts PDF → text  \n",
    "- The extracted text is passed forward into the AI step  \n",
    "\n",
    "This stage functions as the exploration and validation stage where we confirm:  \n",
    "- The PDF is successfully downloaded and readable  \n",
    "- The extracted text is complete enough for understanding  \n",
    "- The text contains essential legal information such as court details and case context  \n",
    "- The text includes the core components required for video explanation such as:  \n",
    "  - **facts**  \n",
    "  - **legal issues**  \n",
    "  - **arguments from both sides**  \n",
    "  - **decision and reasoning / ratio**  \n",
    "\n",
    "c. Cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of numeric feature engineering, this project uses **LLM-ready preprocessing** to ensure the extracted legal text becomes usable for structured generation. The key preparation work included:  \n",
    "- Ensuring the extracted judgment text is passed as a clean, single input to Gemini  \n",
    "- Structuring the output into a predictable JSON format required for automation  \n",
    "- Converting raw legal content into a multi-scene video script that contains:  \n",
    "  - narration  \n",
    "  - duration_seconds  \n",
    "  - visual instructions  \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important transformation is:  \n",
    "**Raw judgment PDF text → structured multi-scene JSON video script**\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Handling missing values or noise (if applicable)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, legal PDFs often contain noise such as:  \n",
    "- line breaks and spacing issues  \n",
    "- headers/footers repeated on every page  \n",
    "- inconsistent formatting across courts  \n",
    "- missing or unclear headings  \n",
    "\n",
    "This was handled practically by:  \n",
    "- relying on Gemini to generate clean structured JSON output instead of depending on raw formatting  \n",
    "- ensuring JSON is valid and parseable in Make  \n",
    "- designing prompts that still produce a complete explainer even if some parts are not explicitly labeled in the judgment"

    "a. AI technique used (ML / DL / NLP / LLM / Recommendation / Hybrid)  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is an **LLM-based NLP pipeline** combined with a video rendering system. It uses:  \n",

    "- **Shotstack API** for rendering the final video from those scenes  \n",

    "c. Justification of design choices  \n",
    "\n",
    "This design is chosen because it solves the problem in the most scalable and automation-friendly way:  \n",
    "- Gemini is used because legal text is unstructured and requires intelligent summarization and restructuring.  \n",
    "- JSON output is essential because Make automation depends on reliable fields to map into downstream modules.  \n",
    "- Iterator + Aggregator is necessary because:  \n",
    "  - the system generates multiple scenes  \n",
    "  - Shotstack requires a single combined timeline for one final render  \n",
    "- Shotstack is used because it renders videos programmatically and returns a hosted output URL without manual editing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This combination makes the system practical, repeatable, and suitable for real product deployment."
