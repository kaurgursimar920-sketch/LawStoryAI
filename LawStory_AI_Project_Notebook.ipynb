    "### a) Selected project track\n",
    "**LLM / NLP + Automation Pipeline (Generative AI for structured summarization + video generation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) Clear problem statement\n",
    "Court judgments are long and complex, making it difficult for students and non‑lawyers to quickly understand the facts, legal issues, arguments, and the court’s reasoning. This project builds an AI system that converts judgments into a **scene‑wise explainer video script**, then renders it into a **multi‑scene text video**.\n",

    "### c) Real‑world relevance and motivation\n",
    "- Helps students revise case law faster  \n",
    "- Improves accessibility of legal information  \n",
    "- Converts dense legal writing into structured, easy‑to‑follow storytelling  \n",
    "- Can be used in legal education and awareness tools\n",

    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "Generate a structured JSON script (multiple scenes) from a judgment and render a final video link using an automated pipeline.\n"

    "- Facts\n",
    "- Issues\n",
    "- Arguments (both sides)\n",
    "- Decision and reasoning\n",

    "- Prepare prompt‑ready text\n",

    "### d) Handling missing values or noise\n",
    "If some sections are missing (e.g., no explicit “issues”), we still generate a usable script by:\n",
    "- Using fallback phrasing (“The main dispute was…”)  \n",
    "- Keeping neutral terms (“Party A / Party B”)\n"
